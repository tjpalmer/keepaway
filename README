This project is intended as a public but unofficial repository for updates to
the Keepaway benchmark player framework created at UT Austin by Gregory
Kuhlmann and Peter Stone.

The intention is that this project can serve as a source for updates and
compatibility with ongoing changes to the RoboCup Soccer Server. However, no
promises are made as to the fitness of this software for any purpose
whatsoever.

The original README from Gregory Kuhlmann and Peter Stone follows. A more
thorough update might be made at some point.

---------------------


This package contains the source code for the Keepaway benchmark 
player framework and the source code for some keepaway utility
programs.  The framework includes all low- and mid-level keepaway
behaviors.  A few example high-level policies are included.  Not
included is any learning code.  However, the framework was designed
to make it easy to insert your own learning code.  Also, not included
is the soccer simulator (see REQUIREMENTS).

The framework was created by

 Gregory Kuhlmann
 and Peter Stone

in the Department of Computer Sciences
at the University of Texas at Austin:

This package was created as part of our research using
the keepaway domain.  The following is a list of selected 
publications:

Keepaway Soccer: From Machine Learning Testbed to Benchmark.
Peter Stone, Gregory Kuhlmann, Matthew E. Taylor, and Yaxin Liu.
In Itsuki Noda, Adam Jacoff, Ansgar Bredenfeld, and Yasutake Takahashi, editors, RoboCup-2005: Robot Soccer World Cup IX, Springer Verlag, Berlin, 2006. To appear.

Reinforcement Learning for RoboCup-Soccer Keepaway.
Peter Stone, Richard S. Sutton, and Gregory Kuhlmann.
Adaptive Behavior, 2005. 

These and other keepaway papers can be found here:
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/Papers/bib2html/

We ask that you please cite these papers if you publish work that builds
off of this framework.

The players are built upon version 3.3 of the UvA Basic team that is 
publicly available from:
http://staff.science.uva.nl/~jellekok/robocup/2003/index_en.html

The communication code is based on:
saymsglib - a library to generate and parse messages in the Coachable agent
communication standard created by Carnegie Mellon University.  It is 
described here:
http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~robosoccer/simulator/comm_standard.html

We provide this code as-is with no support implied.
It has been tested under Debian Linux 3.1 (testing)
